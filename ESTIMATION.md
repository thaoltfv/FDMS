# Project Estimation: Fast Document Management System (FDMS)

This document provides a time estimation for a single, experienced full-stack developer to build the FDMS project as detailed in the `DRAFT.md`.

## Time Estimation for a Single Full-Time Developer

### **Phase 1: Core Backend & API (The "Trunk")**

*   **Tasks:** Database schema design (JSONB approach), setting up the server, implementing models for users, blueprints, and documents, and creating the core CRUD API endpoints.
*   **Estimate: 1 - 2 months**
*   *This phase is foundational. It requires careful planning to get the data structures right, but involves no UI, which simplifies things.*

### **Phase 2: Core Frontend & UI (The "First Shoots")**

*   **Tasks:** Setting up the frontend project, integrating a component library, building a simple blueprint editor, creating the dynamic form renderer for documents, and implementing basic list/detail views.
*   **Estimate: 2 - 3 months**
*   *The dynamic form renderer is the most complex and time-consuming part of this phase. Getting it right is crucial for the entire application.*

### **Phase 3: Key Feature Implementation (Branching Out)**

*   **Tasks:** Implementing a robust permissions system, document stages/workflows, activity logging, and adding support for more complex field types like file uploads and relations.
*   **Estimate: 3 - 5 months**
*   *Each of these is a significant feature. The permissions system and the output generation (PDF/DOCX), in particular, can be deep rabbit holes.*

### **Total Estimated Time for a Robust MVP:**

**Total: 6 - 10 months**

This range represents the time to get from zero to a feature-rich, stable, and usable "Version 1" of the application that includes the most critical features from your draft.

### **Post-MVP / Long-Term Features**

*   **Tasks:** Advanced features like the geospatial widgets, the reference table manager, full workflow automation (triggers, webhooks), import/export, and analytics dashboards.
*   **Estimate: 6+ additional months**
*   *These are major features that could be considered separate projects built on top of the core platform.*

### Key Assumptions and Variables

This estimate could change significantly based on:

*   **Developer Experience:** The estimate assumes a senior developer comfortable with the entire stack (e.g., NestJS/React/PostgreSQL). A less experienced developer could take 1.5x to 2x longer.
*   **Focus:** This assumes 100% dedicated, full-time work. If this is a side project, the timeline will stretch considerably.
*   **Scope Discipline:** The biggest risk to the timeline is scope creep. The 6-10 month estimate depends on sticking strictly to the defined MVP features and resisting the temptation to add "just one more thing."
*   **Quality vs. Speed:** This timeline is for a well-tested, high-quality application. A rough prototype could be built faster, but a production-ready system takes time.
