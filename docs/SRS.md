FDMS revolutionizes document management by treating the backend as a specialized database administration tool. Unlike traditional systems using JSONB storage, FDMS creates dedicated PostgreSQL tables for each document type, enabling:

- **Zero-ETL Analytics**: Direct querying without data warehousing
- **Type-Safe Data Storage**: Database-level constraints for data integrity
- **High-Performance Queries**: Optimized table structures for each document type
- **Direct BI Integration**: Standard SQL access for reporting tools

### 2.2 System Context

users (id, email, password_hash, roles)
roles (id, code, title, permissions)
groups (id, code, title)
group_users (group_id, user_id)

-- Blueprint definition tables
blueprints (id, code, title, table_name)
blueprint_sections (id, blueprint_id, code, title)
blueprint_stages (id, blueprint_id, code, title, sequence)
blueprint_fields (id, blueprint_id, section_id, code, title, config)

```

#### 5.3.2 Dynamic Blueprint Tables

Each blueprint generates a table following the pattern:

```sql
-- Example: Registration blueprint creates
CREATE TABLE registration_documents (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    full_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    age INTEGER,
    registration_date DATE,
    current_stage_id INTEGER REFERENCES blueprint_stages(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    created_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    updated_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id)
